## 1. Project Description
This project, made by Alessia Rossi, Fabio di Gregorio, Ignazio Emanuele Piccich√® and Martina Bertazzoni, has the purpose of profiling patients to understand their contribution to the increase in teleassistance services. The main focus is to identify common patterns and behaviors among patients that are linked to the rise in teleassistance usage. The approach is to group patients based on common patterns or similar behaviors related to the target variable (`incremento_teleassistenze`) and analyze differences among patient groups to determine which features contribute to the increase in teleassistance. The methods used include advanced clustering techniques that consider both patient characteristics and the outcome variable (`incremento_teleassistenze`).

### Supervised Clustering
In this project, we use _**supervised clustering**_ techniques to group patients based on common patterns or behaviors related to the target variable (`incremento_teleassistenze`). Supervised clustering combines the benefits of both supervised and unsupervised learning by incorporating the target variable into the clustering process. This allows us to identify clusters that are not only similar in terms of patient characteristics but also in terms of the target variable. By analyzing the differences among patient groups, we can determine which features contribute to the increase in teleassistance services.

To recap:
- **Objective**: Profile patients to understand their contribution to the increase in teleassistance services.
- **Key Focus**: Identify common patterns and behaviors among patients that are linked to the rise in teleassistance usage.
- **Approach**:
  - Group patients based on common patterns or similar behaviors related to the target variable (`incremento_teleassistenze`).
  - Analyze differences among patient groups to determine which features contribute to the increase in teleassistance.
- **Methods**:
  - Use advanced clustering techniques that consider both patient characteristics and the outcome variable (`incremento_teleassistenze`).

## **2. Enviroment setup**
Before running the code, it's important to take some precautions and set up your environment properly. Follow these steps:
1. Create a Virtual Environment:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv":` python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   - If you're using Windows:    `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - If you're using Unix or MacOS:    `source ./venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Deactivate the Environment (When Finished):
   - Use the following command to deactivate the virtual environment:    `deactivate`
4. Install Dependencies:
   - After cloning the project and activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies using:    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     This command downloads all the non-standard modules required by the application.
5. If your Python version used to generate the virtual environment doesn't contain an updated version of pip, update pip using:  `pip install --upgrade pip `
  
Once you've set up your virtual environment and installed the dependencies, you're ready to run the application. Simply navigate to the `main.py` file and execute it.

## **3. Data Sources**
The data used in this project is organized into two main subdirectories: `raw` for the unprocessed original data and `processed` for the data that has undergone various preprocessing steps. 

For more details, refer to the [Data Directory](./data/README.md).

## **4. Pipeline**
The data processing and analysis pipeline includes the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and remove irrelevant information.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Generate new features from the raw attributes.
3. **Feature Selection**: Retain only the most relevant features for modeling.
4. **Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to group patients based on common patterns or behaviors.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the differences among patient groups to determine which features contribute to the increase in teleassistance.

You can find more details in the _Pipeline Description_ paragraph of the [Project Structure](./myLib/Project_Structure.md) file.

## **5. Outputs Program**
The goal of the challenge is to profile patients by analyzing their contribution to the increase in teleassistance services. This involves identifying common patterns and behaviors among patients that are linked to the rise in teleassistance usage.
