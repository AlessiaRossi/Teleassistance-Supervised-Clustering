# Teleassistance-Supervised-Clustering
This project explores the integration of teleassistance services with supervised clustering techniques.

## Enviroment set up
Before running the code, it's important to take some precautions and set up your environment properly. Follow these steps:
1. Create a Virtual Environment:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv":` python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   - If you're using Windows:    `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - If you're using Unix or MacOS:    `source ./venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Deactivate the Environment (When Finished):
   - Use the following command to deactivate the virtual environment:    `deactivate`
4. Install Dependencies:
   - After cloning the project and activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies using:    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     This command downloads all the non-standard modules required by the application.
5. If your Python version used to generate the virtual environment doesn't contain an updated version of pip, update pip using:  `pip install --upgrade pip `
  
Once you've set up your virtual environment and installed the dependencies, you're ready to run the application. Simply navigate to the `main.py` file and execute it.
